# Cloudstream Extensions Repo

A collection of powerful, native [Cloudstream 3](https://github.com/recloudstream/cloudstream) plugins designed to transform your personal cloud accounts into on-demand streaming services.

## 🔌 Available Plugins

### 1. Telegram & Teleflix Provider
A powerful plugin that streams media directly from your Telegram channels on-demand without downloading files permanently.
* **Teleflix**: A Netflix-style Cinemeta catalogue displaying 20 trending categories (Popular Movies, Popular TV Shows, Featured Top Rated, 2026 Releases, and Action, Sci-Fi, Comedy, Horror, Animation, Thriller, Romance, & Documentary genres), which multi-searches your Telegram channels for streams.
* **Telegram**: Browse and stream media directly from your raw Telegram channels and topic feeds.
* **📦 ZIP File Streaming**: Stream uncompressed video entries directly from inside `.zip` files (including Zip64 files larger than 4GB) on-demand!
* **🔗 Multi-Part Split File Virtual Merging**: Automatically detects and groups split files (`.001`, `.part1`, `.z01`, etc.) into a single unified card. Virtual HTTP byte-range streaming seamlessly stitches parts together during playback across file boundaries!
* **⚡ Smart Search & Filtering**: Automatic episode filtering (matching single episodes `S01E04`, ranges `E01-E04`, and full season packs) while strictly filtering out non-video files (`.png`, `.srt`, `.nfo`, `.txt`). Streams are automatically sorted by file size from highest to lowest!

### 2. Google Drive Provider
A fully-featured plugin to stream videos and audio directly from your personal Google Drive and Shared Drives!
* **Recursive Folder Scanning**: Flattens nested folders into a single episode list for easy binge-watching.
* **Media-Only Filtering**: Automatically hides documents and zip files, only showing valid videos and audio files.
* **Dynamic Posters**: Automatically uses the first video's thumbnail as the cover art for folders.

## 💡 Troubleshooting Playback Issues

If a video fails to play, buffers endlessly, or has no audio, it is likely encoded in a format that Cloudstream's built-in ExoPlayer struggles to decode natively (e.g. heavy HEVC/x265 `.mkv` files).
**Fix**: Simply tap the **"Play in external player"** icon in Cloudstream and choose a robust external player like **MPV (or MPVEX)** or **VLC**—they have much broader codec support and will play the stream flawlessly!
